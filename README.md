# **SafeGamingApi**

SafeGamingApi is a collection of Flask-based APIs designed to enhance the safety, security, and transparency of gaming environments. The suite includes tools for monitoring game file integrity, detecting threats in voice chat, sending timely reminders to players, monitoring system resources, filtering swear words, detecting gambling elements in games, encrypting sensitive data, and preventing fraud.

---

## **Features**

### 1. **Game File Integrity Monitoring**
   - **File**: `Game_transparency.py`
   - **Description**: Monitors the integrity of critical game files and checks if they exist.
   - **Endpoint**: `/status` (GET)
   - **Customization**: Set `GAME_FILES_DIR` and `critical_files` to match your game's directory and critical files.

---

### 2. **Voice Threat Detection**
   - **File**: `Voice_Threat_Detection.py`
   - **Description**: Preprocesses and balances a dataset of labeled sentences, uses a Sentence Transformer model to encode sentences, and calculates cosine similarity for threat detection. Supports real-time voice input for threat detection.
   - **Features**:
     - Dataset loading and cleaning
     - Dataset balancing
     - Bulk and real-time threat detection
     - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
     - Misclassified examples export

---

### 3. **Timely Reminders**
   - **File**: `TimelyReminder.py`
   - **Description**: Sends periodic reminders to players to take breaks. Tracks playtime and supports custom reminders.
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `/start_game_timer` (POST): Starts a timer for a user.
     - `/get_reminders` (GET): Retrieves reminders for a user.
   - **Customization**: Set `reminder_interval_minutes` and `max_reminders`.

---

### 4. **Real-Time System Resource Monitoring**
   - **File**: `RealtimeDataTaken.py`
   - **Description**: Monitors system resource usage in real-time, including camera, microphone, photos access, CPU, and memory usage.
   - **Endpoint**: `/status` (GET)
   - **Features**: Cross-platform support, continuous monitoring via threading.

---

### 5. **Swear Words Filtering**
   - **File**: `HarshwordsEncryption.py`
   - **Description**: Filters swear words from input text and replaces them with '***'.
   - **Endpoint**: `/filter_swear_words` (POST)
   - **Requirements**: A CSV file (`harshwords.txt`) containing swear words.

---

### 6. **Gambling Game Detection**
   - **File**: `Gambling_game_Detection.py`
   - **Description**: Detects if a game involves gambling based on metadata. Checks for betting/wagering, randomness, and rewards.
   - **Endpoint**: `/detect_gambling_game` (POST)
   - **Features**: Handles invalid or missing metadata.

---

### 7. **Data Encryption**
   - **File**: `DataEncryption.py`
   - **Description**: Encrypts and decrypts data using the `cryptography.fernet` library. Supports JSON, text, and files.
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `/encrypt` (POST): Encrypts data or files.
     - `/decrypt` (POST): Decrypts data or files.
   - **Features**: Base64 encoding of encrypted data, automatic key generation.

---

### 8. **Fraud Detection**
   - **File**: `fraud_detection.py`
   - **Description**: Verifies users via facial recognition using ID and selfie photos. Approves users for sending gifts if verification is successful. Includes a random hand emoji condition for added security.
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `/verify` (POST): Verifies a user by comparing their ID photo with a selfie.
     - `/send_gift` (POST): Allows an approved user to send a gift.
   - **Features**:
     - Facial recognition for user verification.
     - Random hand emoji condition.
     - Prevents unauthorized gift sending.

## **Example Requests**

### **Fraud Detection API**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F "id_photo=@id.jpg" -F "selfie=@selfie.jpg" http://0.0.0.0:5000/verify
   ```

2. **Send a Gift**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "sender_id": "123",
       "receiver_id": "456",
       "condition": "‚úåüèª",
       "is_approved": true
   }' http://0.0.0.0:5000/send_gift
   ```

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Database Integration**:
   - Store user verification results and gift transactions in a database.
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
   - Add additional verification steps (e.g., OTP, email confirmation).
3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Prevent abuse by limiting the number of verification attempts.
